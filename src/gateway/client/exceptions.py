CAGE Gateway Client SDK Exception Hierarchy.

This module defines the exception types raised by the CAGE Client SDK when
interacting with the governance gateway. All exceptions are designed to
provide structured, machine-readable error details that enable LLM-based
agents to perform self-correction and replanning.

    Base exception for all CAGE Gateway client errors.

    All exceptions raised by the CAGE Client SDK inherit from this base class,
    enabling clients to catch all gateway-related errors with a single handler.

class PolicyViolationException(CageGatewayError):
    """
    Raised when a proposed action violates governance policy.

    This exception provides structured violation details that enable LLM-based
    agents to understand why the action was rejected and replan accordingly.
    The `recoverable` flag indicates whether the agent should attempt to
    reformulate the request or abandon the task entirely.

    Attributes:
        reason_code: Machine-readable violation code (e.g., "TIER_3_BLOCKED",
            "CBF_UNSAFE", "FTRA_REACHABILITY_DENIED").
        violation_details: Structured dictionary containing:
            - 'failed_tier': The governance tier that rejected the action
            - 'policy_rule': The specific policy rule that was violated
            - 'evidence': Supporting evidence for the violation
            - 'suggested_alternatives': Optional list of alternative actions
        audit_id: Unique identifier for the audit record of this violation.
        recoverable: If True, the agent may reformulate the request; if False,
            the action is fundamentally prohibited and should be abandoned.

    Example:
        try:
            result = await gateway_client.execute_action(action)
        except PolicyViolationException as e:
            if e.recoverable:

class DeferralPending(CageGatewayError):
    """
    Raised when an action requires human-in-the-loop approval and is deferred.

    This exception signals to LangGraph-based agents that they should park the
    current checkpoint and wait for human approval via the deferral ticket system.
    The agent's execution state is preserved in the checkpointer, and execution
    resumes when the ticket is resolved.

    Attributes:
        ticket_id: Unique identifier for the deferral ticket, used to poll for
            resolution or resume execution after human approval.
        defer_reason: Human-readable explanation for why the action was deferred
            (e.g., "High-value trade requires manual approval").
        expires_at: UTC datetime when the deferral ticket expires and the action
            is automatically rejected if no human decision is made.
        ttl_seconds: Time-to-live in seconds (default: 14400 = 4 hours), used
            to calculate `expires_at` if not explicitly provided.

    Example:
        try:

class RoutingSealVerificationError(CageGatewayError):
    """
    Raised when the cryptographic seal on a governance envelope fails verification.

    This exception indicates a critical security failure: either the envelope
    was tampered with in transit, or the gateway's signing key is not trusted
    by the client. Clients should NEVER ignore this exception; doing so would
    bypass the entire governance layer.

    The client SDK automatically verifies the envelope signature using the
    gateway's public key. If verification fails, this exception is raised
    before any action is executed.

    Example:
        try:
            result = await gateway_client.execute_action(action)
